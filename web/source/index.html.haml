      Need a search engine in a Ruby script and got 3 minutes?
      %pre
        %code
          gem install picky
    %p
      and copy paste
      %pre
        %code
          :preserve
            #!/usr/bin/env ruby

            require 'picky'

            # Create an index which is saved into './index' when you
            # run index.dump(). Note that :id is implied - every input
            # object must supply an :id!
            #
            index = Picky::Index.new :people do
              category :age
              category :name
            end

            # Define a data input class. Any object that responds to
            # :id, :age, :name can be added to the index.
            #
            Person = Struct.new :id, :age, :name

            # Add some data objects to the index.
            # IDs can be any unique string or integer.
            #
            index.add Person.new(1, 34, 'Florian is the author of picky')
            index.add Person.new(2, 77, 'Floris is related to Florian')

            # Create a search interface object.
            #
            people = Picky::Search.new index

            # Do a search and remember the results.
            #
            results = people.search 'floris'

            # Show the results.
            #
            p results.ids # => [2]
    %p
      Have fun changing the code to suit your needs :)

    %p
      Need a search engine in a Sinatra server & web frontend and got 10 minutes?
    %code
      %pre
        gem install picky-generators
    %p
      This will also install the needed gems "picky" and "picky-client".
    %p
      Other
      %a{ :href => "#system-requirements-server" } system requirements
      if it doesn't run straightaway.
    %h3 Create a web server
    %p The server generates a library example, which you can run right away.
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          # Generates a directory "app_name"
          # with a new Picky default server project.
          # Type "picky generate" to see other options.

          picky generate server app_name
      %pre
        :preserve
          cd app_name
          bundle install
    %h4 1. Index the data
    %code
      %pre
        rake index
    %h4 2. Start the server
    %code
      %pre
        rake start
    %h4 3. Try a query
    %code
      %pre
        curl localhost:8080/books?query=test
    %p
      Don't worry about the strange looking results!
      The next part (client) will take care of them.

    %h3 The client
    %p The client generates an example app for the "library" example backend, using Sinatra.
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          # Generates a directory "app_name"
          # with a new Picky client Sinatra project.

          picky generate client app_name
    %pre
      :preserve
        cd app_name
        bundle install
    %h4 1. Start the app server
    %code
      %pre
        unicorn -p 3000
    %h4 2. Admire your work
    %p
      Go to
      %a{ :href => 'http://localhost:3000/' } http://localhost:3000/
      and try the examples.
    %h3 Your own search
    %p
      You're probably itching to change the example for
      your own data. How do you do this?
    %h4 The server
    %p In the server directory, just type
    %code
      %pre
        rake todo
    %p and it will tell you where to change the server configuration.
    %h4 The client
    %p
      Go to
      %a{ :href => 'http://localhost:3000/configure' } http://localhost:3000/configure
      and the page will show you how to configure your app server.
    %p
      That's it, congratulations! :)

      %ul
        %li OSX / Linux

    %h3 How does it all work together?
    %p The big picture:
    %img{ :src => 'diagrams/basic-overview.png', :width => '480px' }
    %p
      That's the basic setup. The things to remember are:
      %ol
        %li The Picky server calculates IDs for a query.
        %li Your app server renders results for the resulting IDs.
        %li The Picky JS frontend offers help to the user.
    %p
      Together they are like a small A-Team, something like "Action Search Squad Alpha"! «We've got the results and are heading back to base now, Sir!» Bam!
    %p
      Note that you don't need a Picky client. You could just as well use the results in your Python/Java/PHP app server (If you happen to write a client for one of these, please let me know).

      Right here. I'm happy to help!
      If something doesn't work, send/gist me your app/application.rb
      and I'll look into it.

    %h3 Accompanying Video
    %p
      If you don't have the time or leisure to do it yourself, watch this:
    %iframe{ :src => "http://player.vimeo.com/video/17161012", :width => "460", :height => "365", :frameborder => "0" }
    %p
      Note that the video was made with version 1.0.0.
    %p
      In the latest version, instead of
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          picky project &lt;server dir&gt;
          picky-client sinatra &lt;client dir&gt;
    %p
      the following commands are now used:
    %code
      %pre
        :preserve
          picky generate unicorn_server &lt;server dir&gt;
          picky generate sinatra_client &lt;client dir&gt;
    %p
      A bit more wordy, but hopefully clearer what it does.
